# Estimate of the catalog completeness within the sky localizations of gravitational-wave events.

The code analyzes the gravitational-wave sky localization observed during the O1, O2 and O3a runs from the LIGO and Virgo Collaborations. In particular, we estimate the catalogue completeness within the credible volume provided in the final skymaps issued in the first and second GWTC (Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog).
We used GLADE (v 2.4)  from **Vizier**.

**Vizier** provides the most complete library of published astronomical catalogues --tables and associated data- with verified and enriched data, accessible through multiple interfaces. Query tools allow the user to select relevant data tables and to extract and format records that match certain criteria. More than *21,000 catalogues* are currently available.

In order to get a more complete picture, we identify the intersection area with the Galactic dust extinction and what percentage of the gravitational-wave sky location falls in it. 

A summary table is also provided in which a "completeness coefficient" is determined for each gravitational-wave sky localization.
